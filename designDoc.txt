#Design Notes from 3/22/20
9x9 grid, divided into (9) 3x3 chuncks

Test for a Correctly Solved Puzzle state:
	No (blank or null or 0 or invalid char) tiles 
	No Duplicate numbers [1:9] within:
		-any row
		-any column
		-any of the (9) 3x3 chunks

Input Format
	Line by Line in the cli
	From a File
		*Fill in a GUI
		*Parsed from an Image

Persistent Data:
	Original Unsolved Puzzle State
	Current State of the Puzzle while Solving (placeholder)
	Solving Start Time
	Solved State Array (in case there are multiple solutions)
		-Solution
		-Time needed to Reach this Solution
	Counters (Count Loops as a metric for Improving the Algorithm)

A proper Algorithm for Solving the Puzzle
vs
Bruteforcing ALL Solutions to the Puzzle

###
for i=0, i<9, i++
   for j...
      if blank {check valid choices, iterate over those options, if 
none exist than break; else loop through solving recursively?}

input -> solve -> check valid moves -> solve -> Output {A solution OR 
unsolvable puzzle}
